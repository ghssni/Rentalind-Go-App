To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/ghssni/Rentalind-Go-App.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd Rentalind-Go-App`
3. Install the required dependencies:  
   `go get ....`
4. Set up your MySQL database and import the schema.
5. Update the `config.go` file with your database credentials and Stripe API key.
6. Run the application:  
   `go run main.go`

## Example Use Cases
- **User registration**:  
   `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com","password": "password"}' http://localhost:8080/users`
- **Book rental**:  
   `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"book_id": 1, "rental_date": "2023-03-01", "return_date": "2023-03-15"}' http://localhost:8080/rentals`
